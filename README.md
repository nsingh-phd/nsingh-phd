## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there

I'm a Principal Lead Data Scientist in AgBiotech. I use my quantitative genomics, statistics, and data science skills to lead cross-functional efforts, drive impactful change, and contribute to building top-tier teams.

I mainly focus on solving complex problems by developing proofs-of-concept to ensure project feasibility and collaborating with stakeholders to deliver full-scale cloud solutions, which our scientists then use to develop top-notch products.

I love learning and teaching statistics and data science. I mentor interns and junior scientists in their career development, lead data science academy cohorts, and spread my love for the same with the broader community. I talk about #statbits #statistics #datascience #coding #R #python and #leadership in general.

Let's connect ðŸ‘‹
